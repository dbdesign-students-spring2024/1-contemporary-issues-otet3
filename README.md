The Forbes article discusses a Capital One survey that explores challenges that companies face in managing their data, where it highlights major issues when it comes to  data management, cost control,  cataloging data, and maintaining data governance policies. The article urges the need for companies to practice effective data management strategies to address these challenges.

In comparison to the 3Pillar Global article, the Forbes article puts less emphasis into the specific challenges surrounding unstructured data or real-time data access. The Forbes article focuses more on the challenges posed on companies from a macro perspective, focusing on potential costs on the company.

The article argues that  companies must implement consistent processes to analyze and use data, in order to maximize data accuracy, security, and scalability.
